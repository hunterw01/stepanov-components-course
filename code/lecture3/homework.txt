Lecture 3 homework (long project)

Modify count_operations.h to use a second functor (in addition to
the functor for which sorting algorithm) to describe the shape of
the input data. The default is currently random_shuffle(iota) where
iota is a simple range. We should also look at constant data, pre-
sorted data (increasing and decreasing), valley and hill shaped
data, not completely sorted but increasing (and decreasing) biased
data, and each of the above shapes with various proportions of
repetitious values. Maybe others too, like zipfian distributions,
exponential distributions, normal distributions, etc.
